# Intermittent Expo CLI Dev Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes intermittently without providing helpful error messages. The application itself functions correctly, but the development server becomes unresponsive and requires a manual restart.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the development server.  The crash is intermittent, so it may require multiple attempts or modifying the code slightly to trigger it.  

## Bug Details

The bug results in an unresponsive Expo dev server with no clear error message in the terminal. The application being developed still functions correctly on a connected device or simulator.

## Potential Causes

Several factors might contribute to this issue: 

* **Memory leaks:** Inconsistent memory management within the Expo CLI or the application itself may eventually lead to a crash. 
* **Native module conflicts:** If the application incorporates native modules, conflicts between them or incompatibilities with Expo's environment could trigger crashes. 
* **Unexpected exceptions:**  Unhandled exceptions within the Expo CLI or the application's code, possibly related to asynchronous operations, might cause the server to terminate abruptly. 
* **Environment specifics:** Specific operating systems, versions of Node.js, or other environment factors could be involved.
