The solution involved implementing more robust error handling and logging mechanisms. The following strategies could be combined to improve stability:

1. **Improved Async/Await Handling:** Using try...catch blocks around asynchronous operations to catch potential errors:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('some-api-endpoint');
    const data = await response.json();
    // Process data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., display a fallback message)
  }
}
```

2. **Enhanced Logging:** Adding detailed logging statements throughout the application and the server can help identify the source of the crashes in the future: 

```javascript
console.log('Entering function fetchData'); 
console.log('Data fetched successfully', data);
```

3. **Debugging Tools:** Employ debugging tools provided by Expo or Node.js to examine variables, execution flow, and memory usage during development and help identify potential problems early on.

4. **Version Control:** Make sure that the Expo and other dependencies are the appropriate versions that work with the project. Update dependencies if necessary, but be cautious and check changes before pushing live to any devices.

5. **Check Native Modules:** If any native modules are integrated, verify their compatibility with Expo and the current versions of related SDKs. Thorough testing with native modules is crucial to pinpoint the problematic source if it is linked to those modules.
